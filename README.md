# Silkverb
FDN-based reverb, from notes at https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/writing/2021/lets-write-a-reverb/

## Roadmap

- [x] Diffusion step with multichannel allpass
- [x] Feedback reverb tail
  - [x] More diffusion in the feedback
  - [ ] Filter down the feedback path for high-damping / more control over the sound
- [ ] Chorus modulation of the tail to improve smoothness
- [ ] Pitch shifting of the tail with feedback delay to provide a shimmer effect
- [ ] More (crazier) things to filter the reverb tail ?
